I'm a Ph.D. student in the program of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS) at Princeton University, advised by Dr. Leo Donner.

My interest and past research include modeling atmospheric convective dynamics and atmospheric and cloud mechanisms and systems. I'm currently working on exploring how small scale atmospheric processes can modulate sea salt aerosol (SSA) production. My thesis focuses on cloud feedback related to SSA in the atmosphere and aims to uncover the reasons for the dependency of SSA emission on temperature. This recent development of a potential sea surface temperature (SST) dependency on SSA emission has implications for how strong the feedback of SSA on the climate will be. We proposed an alternative interpretation of the general budget of SSA production that considers these small-scale advective properties of the atmosphere. These mechanisms include synoptic-scale atmospheric dynamics like convective gustiness and precipitation which covaries with temperature.

Furthermore, I previously worked on analyzing the implementation of SSA geoengineering protocol in GFDL models and observed nonlocal effects arising from circulation changes as a result of SSA-induced cooling that would be relevant for extreme events.
